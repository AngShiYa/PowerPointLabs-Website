<p><strong>Auto Zoom</strong> includes two features to help you emphasise important details: <strong>Zoom to Area</strong>, and <strong>Drill Down</strong>.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor-bookmark" id="zoom-to-area"></a>Zoom to Area</h3>
<p><strong>Zoom to Area</strong> allows you to draw the audience's attention to a particular section of the slide by zooming in on it.</p>
<p>To use Zoom to Area, draw a rectangular shape on the portion of the slide you wish to zoom to.</p>
<p><img class="box-shadow slide" src="./img/docs/zoom-to-area-1.png"></p>
<p>Next, select the rectangle, and click the <code>Zoom to Area</code> button.
A single animation slide containing a series of animations will be created to zoom in on the area, as well as to zoom back out again.</p>

  <p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> if you'd like, you can have the animations be inserted
  on separate slides instead. Just open the Auto Zoom settings dialog, and
  check the <code>Put all zoom effects on separate slides</code> option.

<p>
  Zoom to Area can also be used to emphasise multiple areas on the same slide. Simply draw a rectangular shape on each of the areas to zoom in on, then hold
  <code>Ctrl+click</code>
  on each of the shapes in the order they should be displayed in:

</p>
<p>
  Next, click the <code>Zoom to Area</code> button. PowerPointLabs will create an
  animation slide with a series of animations on the current slide to zoom into and pan between the shapes, as well as
  provide an indication of the order in which they'll be displayed in:

  <strong>Note:</strong> if <code>Put all zoom effects on separate slides</code>
  in the Auto Zoom settings dialog is checked, these animations will be
  inserted on separate slides as well.

<h3><a class="anchor-bookmark" id="drill-down"></a>Drill Down</h3>
<p><img class="box-shadow slide" src="./img/docs/drill-down-1.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>Drill Down</strong> allows you to show your audience the bigger picture and progressively zoom into details without overwhelming them with information.</p>
<p>To use Drill Down, you first need to create two slides: one for the &quot;bigger picture&quot; view, and one with the content to drill down into. Leave an empty area on the &quot;big picture&quot; slide where you want the zoom effect to take place:</p>
<p><img src="./img/docs/drill-down-2.png" /></p>
<p>Next, on the &quot;big picture&quot; slide, draw a rectangle in the empty space - this will be where the content from the &quot;drill down&quot; slide will appear.</p>
<p><img src="./img/docs/drill-down-3.png" /></p>
<p>Select the rectangle, and click the <code>Drill Down</code> button.</p>
<p><img src="./img/docs/drill-down-4.png" /></p>
<p>PowerPointLabs will replace the rectangle with an image of the &quot;drill down&quot; slide, and add an animation slide with the zoom effect.</p>
<p><img src="./img/docs/drill-down-5.png" /></p>
<p>If you change the content of the &quot;drill down&quot; slide later, just select the picture and click <code>Drill Down</code> again to regenerate the zoom animation.</p>
<p>To create the effect of zooming back out to the &quot;big picture&quot; slide, simply duplicate the &quot;big picture&quot; slide and place it after the &quot;drill down&quot; slide. Next, select the picture of the &quot;drill down&quot; slide and click <code>Step Back</code>.</p>

<p>The <a href="./samples/tutorial.pptx">Quick Tutorial file</a> also contains a full walkthrough of this process, including both zooming in and out.</p>
