<p>PowerPointLabs also introduces several useful shortcuts to make tasks easier. Here's an overview of what these are, and how to use them.</p>
<h3><img src="./img/docs/misc-1.png" /> Edit Name</h3>
<p>Right-click on any shape, and choose this option to change its name easily. This is especially useful for giving shapes unique names for use with Auto Animate.</p>
<h3><img src="./img/docs/misc-2.png" /> Fit to Height</h3>
<p>Right-click on an image or a shape, and choose this option to automatically resize it so it fits the height of the slide. This is great for using high-resolution images which are much larger than the slide.</p>
<h3><img src="./img/docs/misc-3.png" /> Fit to Width</h3>
<p>Just like Fit to Height, but for images which are a bit too wide. Right-click on an image or shape, and choose this option to resize it so it fits the slide's width.</p>
<h3><img src="./img/docs/misc-4.png" /> Quick Properties</h3>
<p>Instead of the usual two-step process of having to right-click and choose <code>Properties</code> to bring up the Properties window, just double-click the item instead!</p>
<h3><img src="./img/docs/misc-5.png" /> Convert to Picture</h3>
<p>Right-click almost anything and choose this option to convert it into an image on the slide.
This is useful if you want to apply PowerPoint's artistic effects or color adjustments to an object, or resize an object containing text while maintaining the text's relative size.</p>
