**Auto Captions** is a companion feature to Auto Narrate, and can be used to create movie-style captions for each slide's narration. Just like Auto Narrate, Auto Captions uses the text entered in the Speaker Notes pane.

Though captions are displayed alongside their corresponding narration, it isn't necessary to use Auto Narrate if you'd just like the captions without any audio.

Captions can be added to any slide by clicking the `Add Captions` button, and removed using the `Remove Captions`
button.

> **Note:** as with Auto Narrate, it isn't necessary to remove captions when you update the text in the Speaker Notes - just hit `Add Captions` again, and PowerPointLabs will update everything for you.

> Similarly, to add or remove captions to multiple slides at once, simply select them by `Ctrl+Click`ing in the lefthand slide selection pane.
