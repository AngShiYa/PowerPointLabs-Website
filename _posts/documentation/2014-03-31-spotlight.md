  <strong>Spotlight</strong>
  darkens all but a specified region on the slide, allowing you to easily focus your audience's attention on a particular aspect.

<p>Using Spotlight is easy. First, draw a shape to indicate the area which should be lit up - you can use any of PowerPoint's included shapes, or even draw a freeform shape.</p>
<p>
  <img src="./img/docs/spotlight-2.png" />
</p>
<p>To produce the example shown above, we drew a shape like so:</p>
<img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/spotlight-3.png" />
<p>
  With the shape selected (by clicking once on it), go to the
  <code>PowerPointLabs</code>
  tab on the Office Ribbon and click
  <code>Create Spotlight</code>. 
</p>
<p>
  <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/spotlight-4.png" />
</p>
<p>And that's it! PowerPointLabs will create a new slide with the spotlight effect on it.</p>
<p>
  If you'd like, you can adjust the transparency of the darkened area and the softness of the spotlight's edges from the same tab. Just click the options button here:
</p>
<p>
  <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/spotlight-5.png" />
</p> 
<p>
  <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/spotlight-6.png" />
</p>
<p>
  If you're not quite happy with the way things turned out, simply adjust the settings from the
  dialog (shown above), then select the darkened shadow area and click
  <code>Recreate Spotlight</code>.
</p>
