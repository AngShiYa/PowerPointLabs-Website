The **Effects Lab** makes it easy to draw attention to portions of the slide through blur, color, or magnification effects, and also provides a convenient way to access several of PowerPoint's built-in image effects.

### Make Transparent

As its name implies, Make Transparent turns the selected image or shape slightly transparent. This can be used to fade an image for use in the background of a slide, or to use a shape as an overlay to draw attention to a part of the slide.

For example, we'd like to use this image as the background for the title slide; as is, though, there isn't enough contrast between it and the title.

To turn an image or shape transparent, select it, then click `Make Transparent` from the Effects Lab dropdown.

This turns the image slightly transparent, increasing the contrast between it and the slide's text.

### Magnifying Glass

The Magnifying Glass effect can be used to enlarge a small detail on the slide. To use it, first draw a shape over the area to be magnified.

> **Note:** though the example shown here uses a circle, any type of shape can be used as the magnifier.

Select the shape, then click `Magnifying Glass` from the Effects Lab dropdown.

This magnifies the area covered by the shape:
