**Highlight Bullets** can be used to easily emphasise individual bullet points on a slide, allowing each point to stand out in turn as you present it. This can be done in two different ways: **Highlight Text**, and **Highlight Background**.

###Highlight Text
**Highlight Text** can be used when a more subtle approach is desired, and adjusts only the color of each bullet point.

<p>

</p>

To apply the effect to a slide, simply click the `Highlight Text` button on the PowerPointLabs ribbon.

</p>

During the presentation, each bullet point will then be highlighted after a corresponding click, allowing you to go through them point-by-point.

> **Note:** if there are multiple text boxes on the slide with bullet points in them, the order in which the text boxes appear in PowerPoint's [selection pane](http://www.ellenfinkelstein.com/pptblog/the-wonderful-selection-pane-lets-you-easily-hide-objects-select-them-and-even-rename-them/) will be the order in which they will be highlighted.

>If you'd like to specify a different ordering, simply `Ctrl+click` the text boxes in the desired order, then click `Highlight Text`.

###Highlight Background
**Highlight Background** can be used when you want a flashier way of emphasis, and provides an effect similar to that of a real highlighter on paper.

<p>
  <img class="box-shadow slide" src="./img/docs/highlight-background-1.gif">
</p>

To apply this effect to a slide with bullet points on it, just click `Highlight Background` on the PowerPointLabs ribbon.

<p>
  <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/highlight-background-2.png">
</p>

When the presentation is running, each bullet point will be highlighted after a corresponding click.

> **Note:** just as with Highlight Text, multiple text boxes will be highlighted in the order in which they appear in the selection pane.

> To override this ordering, just `Ctrl+click` the text boxes in the order they should be highlighted in, then click `Highlight Background`.
