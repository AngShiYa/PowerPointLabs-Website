The **Shapes Lab** allows you to keep track of and save elements from presentations - shapes, text, images, and so on - that you may want to reuse throughout, or across different presentations. Unlike copying and pasting items to and from the clipboard, the Shapes Lab is persistent - shapes are stored even after PowerPoint has been closed.

To open the Shapes Lab, click on its button on the ribbon:

### Saving Shapes

To save a shape for later use, first select it on the slide, then right-click and select `Add to Shapes Lab`.

The shape will then appear as an entry in the Shapes Lab pane.

> **Note:** selecting a group of items, as in the example above, will save them as a single item in the Shapes Lab.

To change the location in which shapes are saved, right-click on the Shapes Lab pane and select `Settings`. By choosing a shared folder (like one in Dropbox or on a network drive), shapes can be shared between computers and users.

> **Note:** the folder in which shapes should be saved must be empty when selected.

### Managing Shapes

Once a shape has been saved in the Shapes Lab, it can be reused anywhere in the presentation (or even in other presentations). To add a shape to the current slide, either double-click on the entry in the Shapes Lab, or right-click and select `Add to Slide`.

Shapes can also be removed from the Shapes Lab by right-clicking on them and selecting `Remove Shape`. Similarly, a shape can be renamed by selecting `Edit Name`, or by clicking on it after it has been selected.
