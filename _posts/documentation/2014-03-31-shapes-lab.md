The **Shapes Lab** allows you to keep track of and save shapes that you may want to reuse throughout a presentation, or across different presentations. Unlike copying and pasting shapes to and from the clipboard, the Shapes Lab is persistent - shapes are stored even after PowerPoint has been closed.

To open the Shapes Lab, click on its button on the ribbon:

### Saving Shapes

To save a shape for later use, first select it on the slide, then right-click and select `Add to Shapes Lab`.

The shape will then appear as an entry in the Shapes Lab pane.

> **Note:** selecting a group of shapes, as in the example above, will save them as a single item in the Shapes Lab.

### Managing Shapes

Once a shape has been saved in the Shapes Lab, it can be reused anywhere in the presentation (or even in other presentations). To add a shape to the current slide, either double-click on the entry in the Shapes Lab, or right-click and select `Add to Slide`.

Shapes can also be removed from the Shapes Lab by right-clicking on them and selecting `Remove Shape`.
