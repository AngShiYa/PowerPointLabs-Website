        <p>
          <strong>What versions of PowerPoint does PowerPointLabs work with?</strong>
          <br />PowerPointLabs supports PowerPoint 2010 and 2013 on Windows.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Do I need PowerPointLabs installed when I present?</strong>
          <br />Nope! The presentations created with PowerPointLabs can be opened and presented even without the plugin installed - you can display them on other computers without needing to install the plugin on them.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>How do I get new versions of PowerPointLabs?</strong>
          <br />You don't need to do a thing; PowerPointLabs will update itself automatically.

          <strong>Spotlight</strong>
          darkens all but a specified region on the slide, allowing you to easily focus your audience's attention on a particular aspect.
        </p>
        <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/spotlight-1.png" />
        <p>
          <small>(Original Image Credit: Wikipedia)</small>
        </p>
        <p>Using Spotlight is easy. First, draw a shape to indicate the area which should be lit up - you can use any of PowerPoint's included shapes, or even draw a freeform shape.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/spotlight-2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>To produce the example shown above, we drew a shape like so:</p>
        <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/spotlight-3.png" />
        <p>
          With the shape selected (by clicking once on it), go to the
          <code>PowerPointLabs</code>
          tab on the Office Ribbon and click
          <code>Create Spotlight</code>. If you'd like, you can also adjust the transparency of the darkened area and the softness of the spotlight's edges from the same tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/spotlight-4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>And that's it! PowerPointLabs will create a new slide with the spotlight effect on it.</p>
        <p>
          If you're not quite happy with the way things turned out, simply adjust the settings from the
          <code>PowerPointLabs</code>
          tab (shown above), then select the darkened shadow area and click
          <code>Recreate Spotlight</code>.
        </p>

            <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="auto-animate"></a>Auto Animate
            <small><a href="./samples/auto-animate%20sample.pptx">[Sample Slides]</a>

        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>Auto Animate</strong>
          makes creating slick animations as easy as specifying the start and end positions. The animation in the following video was created using Auto Animate.
        </p>
        <iframe style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tX381vX8D6M?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
          <br/>First, create a slide that will serve as the starting position of the animation: the
          <strong>start slide</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>For the animation above, our start slide looks like this. Each of the items here is a separate shape, created using PowerPoint's shape tools.</p>
        <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/auto-animate-1.png" />
        <p>
          <br/>Next, create the slide that will serve as the ending position of the animation - our
          <strong>end slide</strong>
          - by duplicating the start slide. This can be done either by right-clicking the slide in the slide list and selecting
          <code>Duplicate Slide</code>, or by clicking on it and pressing
          <code>Ctrl+D</code>
          on the keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>Once the end slide has been created, modify the shapes on it so they resemble the state they should be in at the end of the animation.</p>
        <p>In our example, the end slide looks like this (with the changes magnified in detail on the right):</p>
        <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/auto-animate-2.png" />
        <p>
          <br />To create the actual animation, select the start slide, go to the
          <code>PowerPointLabs</code>
          tab in the Office Ribbon, and click
          <code>Add Animation Slide</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-3.png" />
        </p>
        <p>PowerPointLabs will create a new slide in between the start and end slides: the
          <strong>animation slide</strong>. These slides contain the actual animation effects, and can be identified by the PowerPointLabs logo in the top right corner.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Don't worry: the PowerPointLabs logo is invisible during the actual slide show.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>That's all there is to it! You can play the slides to see how the animation turned out.</p>

          </strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Adjusting Animations</h3>
        <p>
          The easiest way to tweak the animations is to adjust the shapes in the start and/or end slides, then select the animation slide and click
          <code>Recreate Animation</code>
          in the
          <code>PowerPointLabs</code>
          tab in the Office Ribbon.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-5.png" />
        </p>
        <p>If you'd like a more hands-on approach, you can manually tweak the animations using the <a href="http://presentationsoft.about.com/od/powerpointanimations/ss/120711-change-speed-powerpoint-animation_2.htm">PowerPoint animations pane.</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Animation Tips and Tricks</h3>
        <h4>Wrong Shapes being Animated?</h4>
        <p>This can happen when PowerPointLabs can't figure out which shapes in the end slide correspond to those in the start slide. You can fix this by ensuring matching shapes have the same name on both slides, using the <a href="http://www.ellenfinkelstein.com/pptblog/the-wonderful-selection-pane-lets-you-easily-hide-objects-select-them-and-even-rename-them/">selection pane.</a>
        </p>
        <p>For example, notice how we have named the four green circles here
          <code>c1</code>,
          <code>c2</code>,
          <code>c3</code>, and
          <code>c4</code>on both the start and end slides.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-6.png" />
        </p>
        <p>To rename a shape, either right-click on it and select
          <code>Edit name</code>, or click on it in the selection pane.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            if multiple shapes on the same slide share a single name, the wrong shapes may be animated.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4>Moving Shapes Together</h4>
        <p>
          The easiest way to have many shapes moving together as one is to group them first. This can be done by selecting the shapes (either through the selection pane or by
          <code>Ctrl+click</code>
          ing them), right-clicking, and selecting
          <code>Group</code>.
        </p>


        <h2>Animate In Slide</h2>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-9.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Animate In Slide</strong>
          can be used to create slick animations within a slide, just like those shown below:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-7.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>To use Animate In Slide, place a copy of the shape to be animated at each &quot;stop&quot; along the desired animation path. Next, select the shapes in the order to be animated (by
          <code>Ctrl+click</code>ing them), then click the
          <code>Animate In Slide</code>
          button.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-8.png" />
        </p>
        <p>To modify the animation, just move the shapes as necessary, select them, and click the
          <code>Animate In Slide</code>
          button again.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Auto Narrate</strong>
          creates synthesized audio from your speaker notes, and embeds it on each slide. It's great for figuring out exactly what your speech will sound like, or creating pre-packaged presentations that can play automatically.</p>
        <p>Auto Narrate uses the text entered in the Speaker Notes pane below each slide to generate audio:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-narrate-2.png">
        </p>
        <p>Simply type what you'd like to say for the slide in the Speaker Notes, then click the
          <code>Add Audio</code>
          button; to hear what it sounds like immediately, check the
          <code>Preview</code>
          option. You can remove audio easily by clicking
          <code>Remove Audio</code>.</p>
        <p>To hear what a particular sentence or phrase will sound like without having to add audio for the entire slide, simply select it in the Speaker Notes pane, right-click, and choose
          <code>Speak Selected Text</code>.</p>
        <p>
          <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/auto-narrate-3.png">
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Note</strong>: if you make changes to your speech, it isn't necessary to remove any audio that's already been embedded; PowerPointLabs will automatically take care of it when you click
            <code>Add Audio</code>
            again.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>If you'd like to add or remove audio on all the slides in your presentation, simply check the
          <code>All Slides</code>
          option. PowerPointLabs will use each slide's speaker notes when generating audio.</p>
        <h3>Tags</h3>
        <p>For more fine-grained control over the generated audio, you can use a variety of
          <strong>tags</strong>
          to specify aspects such as speed, pronunciation, and even the type of voice to use.</p>
        <p>Tags come in two types:
          <em>paired</em>
          and
          <em>unpaired</em>.</p>
        <h4>Paired Tags</h4>
        <p>A paired set of tags encloses a particular word or phrase, and is used to inform PowerPointLabs how to vocalise that particular section of text.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            [Speed: &lt;fast/medium/slow/extra fast/extra slow&gt;] &lt;Text to say&gt; [EndSpeed]
            <ul>
              <li>Specifies the speed at which the enclosed text should be read.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            [Voice: &lt;voice name&gt;] &lt;Text to say&gt; [EndVoice]
            <ul>
              <li>Specifies the voice the enclosed text should be read in.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            [Pronounce: &lt;IPA pronunciation&gt;] &lt;Word to pronounce&gt; [EndPronounce]
            <ul>
              <li>Specifies a particular pronunciation to use for the enclosed word.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, to have a particular sentence read at a quick pace, we would use:
          <code>[Speed: fast]This sentence will be read quickly![EndSpeed]</code>
        </p>
        <h4>Unpaired Tags</h4>
        <p>An unpaired tag is used to specify information that doesn't relate to a particular word or phrase.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            [Pause: &lt;duration in seconds&gt;]
            <ul>
              <li>Inserts a pause at this point in the narration.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            [AfterClick]
            <ul>
              <li>Triggers any narration after this point only after a &quot;click&quot; on the slide.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Note</strong>: the AfterClick tag is especially useful if you have existing animations on the slide which are triggered by clicks. PowerPointLabs will set narration to play after all animations triggered by the corresponding click have completed.</p>

          <strong>Auto Captions</strong>
          is a companion feature to Auto Narrate, and can be used to create movie-style captions for each slide's narration. Just like Auto Narrate, Auto Captions uses the text entered in the Speaker Notes pane.</p>

        <p>
          Though captions are displayed alongside their corresponding narration, it isn't necessary to use Auto Narrate if you'd just like the captions without any audio.</p>

        <p>Captions can be added to any slide by clicking the
          <code>Add Captions</code>
          button, and removed using the
          <code>Remove Captions</code>
          button.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Note</strong>: as with Auto Narrate, it isn't necessary to remove captions when you update the text in the Speaker Notes - just hit
            <code>Add Captions</code>
            again, and PowerPointLabs will update everything for you.</p>
