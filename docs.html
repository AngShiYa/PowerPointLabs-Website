        <p>
          <strong>What versions of PowerPoint does PowerPointLabs work with?</strong>
          <br />PowerPointLabs supports PowerPoint 2010 and 2013 on Windows.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Do I need PowerPointLabs installed when I present?</strong>
          <br />Nope! The presentations created with PowerPointLabs can be opened and presented even without the plugin installed - you can display them on other computers without needing to install the plugin on them.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>How do I get new versions of PowerPointLabs?</strong>
          <br />You don't need to do a thing; PowerPointLabs will update itself automatically.

          <strong>Spotlight</strong>
          darkens all but a specified region on the slide, allowing you to easily focus your audience's attention on a particular aspect.
        </p>
        <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/spotlight-1.png" />
        <p>
          <small>(Original Image Credit: Wikipedia)</small>
        </p>
        <p>Using Spotlight is easy. First, draw a shape to indicate the area which should be lit up - you can use any of PowerPoint's included shapes, or even draw a freeform shape.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/spotlight-2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>To produce the example shown above, we drew a shape like so:</p>
        <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/spotlight-3.png" />
        <p>
          With the shape selected (by clicking once on it), go to the
          <code>PowerPointLabs</code>
          tab on the Office Ribbon and click
          <code>Create Spotlight</code>. If you'd like, you can also adjust the transparency of the darkened area and the softness of the spotlight's edges from the same tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/spotlight-4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>And that's it! PowerPointLabs will create a new slide with the spotlight effect on it.</p>
        <p>
          If you're not quite happy with the way things turned out, simply adjust the settings from the
          <code>PowerPointLabs</code>
          tab (shown above), then select the darkened shadow area and click
          <code>Recreate Spotlight</code>.

        <p>
          <strong>Auto Animate</strong>
          makes creating slick animations as easy as specifying the start and end positions. The animation in the following video was created using Auto Animate.
        </p>
        <iframe style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tX381vX8D6M?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
          <br/>First, create a slide that will serve as the starting position of the animation: the
          <strong>start slide</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>For the animation above, our start slide looks like this. Each of the items here is a separate shape, created using PowerPoint's shape tools.</p>
        <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/auto-animate-1.png" />
        <p>
          <br/>Next, create the slide that will serve as the ending position of the animation - our
          <strong>end slide</strong>
          - by duplicating the start slide. This can be done either by right-clicking the slide in the slide list and selecting
          <code>Duplicate Slide</code>, or by clicking on it and pressing
          <code>Ctrl+D</code>
          on the keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>Once the end slide has been created, modify the shapes on it so they resemble the state they should be in at the end of the animation.</p>
        <p>In our example, the end slide looks like this (with the changes magnified in detail on the right):</p>
        <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/auto-animate-2.png" />
        <p>
          <br />To create the actual animation, select the start slide, go to the
          <code>PowerPointLabs</code>
          tab in the Office Ribbon, and click
          <code>Add Animation Slide</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-3.png" />
        </p>
        <p>PowerPointLabs will create a new slide in between the start and end slides: the
          <strong>animation slide</strong>. These slides contain the actual animation effects, and can be identified by the PowerPointLabs logo in the top right corner.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Don't worry: the PowerPointLabs logo is invisible during the actual slide show.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>That's all there is to it! You can play the slides to see how the animation turned out.</p>

          </strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Adjusting Animations</h3>
        <p>
          The easiest way to tweak the animations is to adjust the shapes in the start and/or end slides, then select the animation slide and click
          <code>Recreate Animation</code>
          in the
          <code>PowerPointLabs</code>
          tab in the Office Ribbon.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-5.png" />
        </p>
        <p>If you'd like a more hands-on approach, you can manually tweak the animations using the <a href="http://presentationsoft.about.com/od/powerpointanimations/ss/120711-change-speed-powerpoint-animation_2.htm">PowerPoint animations pane.</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Animation Tips and Tricks</h3>
        <h4>Wrong Shapes being Animated?</h4>
        <p>This can happen when PowerPointLabs can't figure out which shapes in the end slide correspond to those in the start slide. You can fix this by ensuring matching shapes have the same name on both slides, using the <a href="http://www.ellenfinkelstein.com/pptblog/the-wonderful-selection-pane-lets-you-easily-hide-objects-select-them-and-even-rename-them/">selection pane.</a>
        </p>
        <p>For example, notice how we have named the four green circles here
          <code>c1</code>,
          <code>c2</code>,
          <code>c3</code>, and
          <code>c4</code>on both the start and end slides.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-6.png" />
        </p>
        <p>To rename a shape, either right-click on it and select
          <code>Edit name</code>, or click on it in the selection pane.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            if multiple shapes on the same slide share a single name, the wrong shapes may be animated.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4>Moving Shapes Together</h4>
        <p>
          The easiest way to have many shapes moving together as one is to group them first. This can be done by selecting the shapes (either through the selection pane or by
          <code>Ctrl+click</code>
          ing them), right-clicking, and selecting
          <code>Group</code>.
        </p>


        <h3><a class="anchor-bookmark" id="animate-in-slide"></a>Animate In Slide</h3>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-9.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Animate In Slide</strong>
          can be used to create slick animations within a slide, just like those shown below:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-7.gif" />
        </p>
        <p>To use Animate In Slide, place a copy of the shape to be animated at each &quot;stop&quot; along the desired animation path. Next, select the shapes in the order to be animated (by
          <code>Ctrl+click</code>ing them), then click the
          <code>Animate In Slide</code>
          button.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-8.png" />
        </p>
        <p>To modify the animation, just move the shapes as necessary, select them, and click the
          <code>Animate In Slide</code>
          button again.</p>

          <strong>Auto Narrate</strong>
          creates synthesized audio from your speaker notes, and embeds it on each slide. It's great for figuring out exactly what your speech will sound like, or creating pre-packaged presentations that can play automatically.</p>
        <p>Auto Narrate uses the text entered in the Speaker Notes pane below each slide to generate audio:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-narrate-2.png">
        </p>
        <p>Simply type what you'd like to say for the slide in the Speaker Notes, then click the
          <code>Add Audio</code>
          button; to hear what it sounds like immediately, check the
          <code>Preview</code>
          option. You can remove audio easily by clicking
          <code>Remove Audio</code>.</p>
        <p>To hear what a particular sentence or phrase will sound like without having to add audio for the entire slide, simply select it in the Speaker Notes pane, right-click, and choose
          <code>Speak Selected Text</code>.</p>
        <p>
          <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/auto-narrate-3.png">
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Note</strong>: if you make changes to your speech, it isn't necessary to remove any audio that's already been embedded; PowerPointLabs will automatically take care of it when you click
            <code>Add Audio</code>
            again.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>If you'd like to add or remove audio on all the slides in your presentation, simply check the
          <code>All Slides</code>
          option. PowerPointLabs will use each slide's speaker notes when generating audio.</p>
        <h3>Tags</h3>
        <p>For more fine-grained control over the generated audio, you can use a variety of
          <strong>tags</strong>
          to specify aspects such as speed, pronunciation, and even the type of voice to use.</p>
        <p>Tags come in two types:
          <em>paired</em>
          and
          <em>unpaired</em>.</p>

        <h3>Paired Tags</h3>
        <p>A paired set of tags encloses a particular word or phrase, and is used to inform PowerPointLabs how to vocalise that particular section of text.</p>
        <h4>Speed</h4>
        <p>Speed tags are used to specify the pace at which the text they enclose should be read.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Syntax:</strong>
            <code>[Speed: &lt;fast/medium/slow/extra fast/extra slow&gt;]</code>&lt;Text to say&gt;
            <code>[EndSpeed]</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
            <code>[Speed: slow]</code>This point is very important.
            <code>[EndSpeed]</code>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4>Voice</h4>
        <p>Voice tags can be used to change the synthesized voice for a particular section of text. You can see a list of all voices installed on your computer in the
          <code>Default Voice</code>dropdown:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-narrate-4.png" />
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>there's no need to type the entire name displayed in the dropdown; PowerPointLabs will choose the first voice that contains the portion that you enter.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <span></span>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Syntax:</strong>
            <code>[Voice: &lt;voice name\&gt;]</code>&lt;Text to say&gt;
            <code>[EndVoice]</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
            <code>[Voice: David]</code>Hello there!
            <code>[EndVoice]</code>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4>Pronounce</h4>
        <p>Pronounce tags can be used to specify the way a word should be pronounced, using <a href="http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/fullchart.html">IPA notation.</a> This can be useful in situations where the generated speech uses a particular pronunciation of a word which isn't correct in context.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>the <a href="http://www.dictionary.com">Dictionary.com</a> definition pages include IPA pronunciations that can be used with the Pronounce tag.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <span></span>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Syntax:</strong>
            <code>[Pronounce: &lt;IPA pronunciation\&gt;]</code>&lt;Word to pronounce&gt;
            <code>[EndPronounce]</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>I
            <code>[Pronounce: rɛd]</code>read
            <code>[EndPronounce]</code>that book a while ago.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Unpaired Tags</h3>
        <p>An unpaired tag is used to specify information that doesn't relate to a particular word or phrase.</p>
        <h4>Pause</h4>
        <p>As its name implies, the Pause tag can be used to specify a pause in the narration. This is useful for creating short breaks between sentences or ideas.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Syntax:</strong>
            <code>[Pause: &lt;duration in seconds\&gt;]</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>That's an important point.
            <code>[Pause: 3]</code>Let's move on to discuss...</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4>AfterClick</h4>
        <p>The AfterClick tag is used to set portions of narration to be triggered only after the slide is clicked.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Note</strong>: this tag is especially useful if you have existing animations on the slide which are triggered by clicks. PowerPointLabs will set narration to play after all animations triggered by the corresponding click have completed.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <span></span>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>

          <strong>Auto Captions</strong>
          is a companion feature to Auto Narrate, and can be used to create movie-style captions for each slide's narration. Just like Auto Narrate, Auto Captions uses the text entered in the Speaker Notes pane.</p>

        <p>
          Though captions are displayed alongside their corresponding narration, it isn't necessary to use Auto Narrate if you'd just like the captions without any audio.</p>

        <p>Captions can be added to any slide by clicking the
          <code>Add Captions</code>
          button, and removed using the

          button.</p>

          <p>
            <strong>Note</strong>: as with Auto Narrate, it isn't necessary to remove captions when you update the text in the Speaker Notes - just hit

        <p>
          <strong>Auto Zoom</strong>
          allows you to progressively drill down into details without your audience losing sight of the big picture, while preventing them from being overwhelmed with information.
          </p>
        <p>To use Auto Zoom, you first need to create two slides: one for the &quot;bigger picture&quot; view, and one with the content to drill down into. Leave an empty area on the &quot;big picture&quot; slide where you want the zoom effect to take place:</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-zoom-2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Next, on the &quot;big picture&quot; slide, draw a rectangle in the empty space - this will be where the content from the &quot;drill down&quot; slide will appear.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-zoom-3.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the rectangle, and click the
          <code>Zoom In</code>
          button.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-zoom-4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>PowerPointLabs will replace the rectangle with an image of the &quot;drill down&quot; slide, and add an animation slide with the zoom effect.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-zoom-5.png" />
        </p>
        <p>If you change the content of the &quot;drill down&quot; slide later, just select the picture and click
          <code>Zoom In</code>
          again to regenerate the zoom animation.</p>
        <h3>Zooming Out</h3>
        <p>To create the effect of zooming back out to the &quot;big picture&quot; slide, simply duplicate the &quot;big picture&quot; slide and place it after the &quot;drill down&quot; slide. Next, select the picture of the &quot;drill down&quot; slide and click
          <code>Zoom Out</code>.</p>

        <p>The <a href="./samples/tutorial.pptx">Quick Tutorial file</a> also contains a full walkthrough of this process, including both zooming in and out.</p>

          </h2>
        </div>

        <p>PowerPointLabs also introduces several useful shortcuts to the right-click context menu. Here's an overview of what these are, and how to use them.</p>
        <h3><img src="./img/docs/misc-1.png" /> Edit Name</h3>
        <p>Right-click on any shape, and choose this option to change its name easily. This is especially useful for giving shapes unique names for use with Auto Animate.</p>
        <h3><img src="./img/docs/misc-2.png" /> Fit to Height</h3>
        <p>Right-click on an image or a shape, and choose this option to automatically resize it so it fits the height of the slide. This is great for using high-resolution images which are much larger than the slide.</p>
        <h3><img src="./img/docs/misc-3.png" /> Fit to Width</h3>
        <p>Just like Fit to Height, but for images which are a bit too wide. Right-click on an image or shape, and choose this option to resize it so it fits the slide's width.</p>
        <h3><img src="./img/docs/misc-4.png" /> Quick Properties</h3>
        <p>Instead of the usual two-step process of having to right-click and choose <code>Properties</code> to bring up the Properties window, just double-click the item instead!</p>
