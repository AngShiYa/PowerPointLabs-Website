          <strong>What versions of PowerPoint does PowerPointLabs work with?</strong>
          <br />PowerPointLabs supports PowerPoint 2010 and 2013 on Windows.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Do I need PowerPointLabs installed when I present?</strong>
          <br />Nope! The presentations created with PowerPointLabs can be opened and presented even without the plugin installed - you can display them on other computers without needing to install the plugin on them.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>How do I get new versions of PowerPointLabs?</strong>
          <br />You don't need to do a thing; PowerPointLabs will update itself automatically.

          <strong>Spotlight</strong>
          darkens all but a specified region on the slide, allowing you to easily focus your audience's attention on a particular aspect.

        </p>
        <p>Using Spotlight is easy. First, draw a shape to indicate the area which should be lit up - you can use any of PowerPoint's included shapes, or even draw a freeform shape.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/spotlight-2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>To produce the example shown above, we drew a shape like so:</p>
        <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/spotlight-3.png" />
        <p>
          With the shape selected (by clicking once on it), go to the
          <code>PowerPointLabs</code>
          tab on the Office Ribbon and click
          <code>Create Spotlight</code>. If you'd like, you can also adjust the transparency of the darkened area and the softness of the spotlight's edges from the same tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/spotlight-4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>And that's it! PowerPointLabs will create a new slide with the spotlight effect on it.</p>
        <p>
          If you're not quite happy with the way things turned out, simply adjust the settings from the
          <code>PowerPointLabs</code>
          tab (shown above), then select the darkened shadow area and click
          <code>Recreate Spotlight</code>.

            <a class="anchor-bookmark" id="auto-animate"></a>Auto Animate
            <small><a href="./samples/auto-animate%20sample.pptx">[Sample Slides]</a></small>

        <p>
          <strong>Auto Animate</strong>
          makes creating slick animations as easy as specifying the start and end positions. The animation in the following video was created using Auto Animate.
        </p>
        <iframe style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tX381vX8D6M?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
          <br/>First, create a slide that will serve as the starting position of the animation: the
          <strong>start slide</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>For the animation above, our start slide looks like this. Each of the items here is a separate shape, created using PowerPoint's shape tools.</p>
        <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/auto-animate-1.png" />
        <p>
          <br/>Next, create the slide that will serve as the ending position of the animation - our
          <strong>end slide</strong>
          - by duplicating the start slide. This can be done either by right-clicking the slide in the slide list and selecting
          <code>Duplicate Slide</code>, or by clicking on it and pressing
          <code>Ctrl+D</code>
          on the keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>Once the end slide has been created, modify the shapes on it so they resemble the state they should be in at the end of the animation.</p>
        <p>In our example, the end slide looks like this (with the changes magnified in detail on the right):</p>
        <img class="box-shadow" src="./img/docs/auto-animate-2.png" />
        <p>
          <br />To create the actual animation, select the start slide, go to the
          <code>PowerPointLabs</code>
          tab in the Office Ribbon, and click
          <code>Add Animation Slide</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-3.png" />
        </p>
        <p>PowerPointLabs will create a new slide in between the start and end slides: the
          <strong>animation slide</strong>. These slides contain the actual animation effects, and can be identified by the PowerPointLabs logo in the top right corner.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Don't worry: the PowerPointLabs logo is invisible during the actual slide show.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>That's all there is to it! You can play the slides to see how the animation turned out.</p>

        <h3>Adjusting Animations</h3>
        <p>
          The easiest way to tweak the animations is to adjust the shapes in the start and/or end slides, then select the animation slide and click
          <code>Recreate Animation</code>
          in the
          <code>PowerPointLabs</code>
          tab in the Office Ribbon.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-5.png" />
        </p>
        <p>If you'd like a more hands-on approach, you can manually tweak the animations using the <a href="http://presentationsoft.about.com/od/powerpointanimations/ss/120711-change-speed-powerpoint-animation_2.htm">PowerPoint animations pane.</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Animation Tips and Tricks</h3>
        <h4>Wrong Shapes being Animated?</h4>
        <p>This can happen when PowerPointLabs can't figure out which shapes in the end slide correspond to those in the start slide. You can fix this by ensuring matching shapes have the same name on both slides, using the <a href="http://www.ellenfinkelstein.com/pptblog/the-wonderful-selection-pane-lets-you-easily-hide-objects-select-them-and-even-rename-them/">selection pane.</a>
        </p>
        <p>For example, notice how we have named the four green circles here
          <code>c1</code>,
          <code>c2</code>,
          <code>c3</code>, and
          <code>c4</code>on both the start and end slides.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="./img/docs/auto-animate-6.png" />
        </p>
        <p>To rename a shape, either right-click on it and select
          <code>Edit name</code>, or click on it in the selection pane.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong>
            if multiple shapes on the same slide share a single name, the wrong shapes may be animated.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4>Moving Shapes Together</h4>
        <p>
          The easiest way to have many shapes moving together as one is to group them first. This can be done by selecting the shapes (either through the selection pane or by
          <code>Ctrl+click</code>
          ing them), right-clicking, and selecting
          <code>Group</code>.
